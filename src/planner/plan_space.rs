//! The unified, configuration-driven path planner's vocabulary.
//!
//! One request type (`PlanRequest`) parameterizes the ENTIRE space of machine
//! topologies the cap category and tagged-URN order theory permit — from today's
//! single-source linear transmute to heterogeneous multi-source convergence,
//! multi-target divergence, and general DAGs. See
//! `docs/planner-configuration-space.md` for the theory; this module is the
//! concrete surface.
//!
//! ## The picture
//!
//! A plan connects a **source multiset** to a **target set**. Convergence (fan-in)
//! is a cospan whose apex slides along the strand: at the source end it degenerates
//! to a single (possibly generalized) source — today's default; at the target end
//! it is fully-independent legs meeting only at the target; absent, it is
//! independent parallel paths (a map). Divergence (fan-out) is the dual span.
//!
//! Every field below is a knob. `Auto` fills unset knobs by intent-inference and
//! returns MULTIPLE ranked candidates (top = the "magic" default); `Configured`
//! honours the caller's knobs. `|sources| == 1` with the default policies
//! reproduces the current single-source strands exactly.
