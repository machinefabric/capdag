//! capture — DEVICE-reference transport resolution (13.2 §Reference Media,
//! live family).
//!
//! The device analog of file-path reading: a cap declares an arg whose urn
//! is the live REFERENCE and whose `stdin` source is the CONTENT the feed
//! delivers; the RESOLVING RUNTIME — the cartridge runtime when the
//! consumer is an op, the HOST when the cartridge cannot reach the device
//! or when the host itself consumes the items (engine-side per-item
//! dispatch) — recognizes the reference, opens the device, and delivers
//! the content stream. The op (or the engine's region driver) is
//! transport-blind.
//!
//! This is NOT a plugin system: the set of capture backends is closed and
//! known at compile time, dispatched by reference-URN family in plain code
//! below — exactly as file paths are read by plain code, with no registry
//! and no registration. The hardware backends (microphone, webcam) sit
//! behind the `capture` cargo feature (they carry the vendored ffmpeg
//! device stack); the deterministic synthetic feed is always built. A
//! reference whose family has no backend — or a hardware family in a build
//! without the feature — is a HARD, named error, never a silent empty
//! feed.
