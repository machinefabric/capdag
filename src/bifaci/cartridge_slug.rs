//! Cartridge registry slug — deterministic mapping from a registry URL
//! to a top-level folder name under the cartridges install root.
//!
//! Registries are identified by their full URL (the exact byte string
//! the user/operator typed; no normalization, scheme stripping, slash
//! trimming, or path canonicalization). The first 16 hex chars of the
//! URL's SHA-256 form the folder name on disk. The literal string
//! `"dev"` is reserved for dev cartridges that have no registry — it
//! cannot collide with the 16-hex slug space.
//!
//! The mapping is one-way: folder → URL is recovered from each
//! installed cartridge's own `cartridge.json:registry_url`. The
//! installer/host validates `slug_for(cartridge_json.registry_url) ==
//! folder_name` at parse time.

/// old-schema payloads where the key is absent entirely, instead of
/// silently treating them as dev installs.

/// Use as the field type and add `#[serde(deserialize_with = "deserialize_required_nullable_string")]`

/// `Deserialize` on the parent struct. We expose this helper for

/// to centralize the "decode Option<String>, but the caller has
/// already verified presence" decode step.
