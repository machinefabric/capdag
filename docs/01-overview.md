## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Tagged URN** | A URN with structure `prefix:key1=value1;key2=value2;...` |
| **Media URN** | A Tagged URN with prefix `media:` describing a data type |
| **Cap URN** | A Tagged URN with prefix `cap:` describing a capability |
| **Pattern** | A URN used as a template or constraint |
| **Instance** | A URN representing a concrete value or request |
| **Provider** | A registered capability that can handle requests |
| **Request** | A capability URN describing what is needed |
| **Dispatch** | The act of routing a request to a valid provider |
| **Specificity** | A numeric score measuring how constrained a URN is |
| **Wildcard** | A special value (`*`, `?`, `!`) with matching semantics |
| **Machine** | An ordered collection of MachineStrands wired into data-flow graphs |
| **MachineStrand** | A maximal connected component of resolved cap edges with anchors |
| **Machine notation** | The textual encoding of a Machine (see [09-MACHINE-NOTATION](/docs/09-machine-notation)) |
| **Cartridge** | A standalone binary that provides one or more capabilities |
| **Cap Kind** | A logical classification of a cap into one of *Identity*, *Source*, *Sink*, *Effect*, or *Transform*, derived from `(in, out, y, effect)`. See [06-CAP-URN-STRUCTURE §4](/docs/06-cap-urn-structure#4-cap-kinds). |
| **Top type** | `media:` — the universal wildcard for media URNs. Every media URN conforms to it. A side typed `media:` reads as "any A." |
| **Unit type** | `media:void` — the nullary value. A side typed `media:void` reads as "()": no meaningful data flows there. Distinct from the top type. **Atomic**: refinements like `media:void;text` are parse errors. |

## Notational Conventions

### Order-Theoretic Notation

- `a <=  b` — "a is at least as specific as b" (a refines b)
- `a >= b` — "a is at least as general as b" (equivalent to b <= a)

### Cap URN Components

A Cap URN `c` is written as a quadruple:
```
c = (i, o, y, e)
```
where:
- `i` = input media URN (the `in` tag value)
- `o` = output media URN (the `out` tag value)
- `y` = non-direction cap-tags (op, ext, model, etc. — all arbitrary, none has functional privilege)
- `e` = effect on runtime media/type identity

## Foundation

This specification builds on the mathematical foundations in [02-FORMAL-FOUNDATIONS](/docs/02-formal-foundations), which defines the core dispatch relation:

```
Dispatch(p, r) <=> i_r <= i_p /\ o_p <= o_r /\ (e_r = ? \/ e_p = e_r) /\ y_r <= y_p
```

The numbered documents fill in operational details: wildcard truth tables, normalization rules, specificity scoring, validation constraints, machine notation, protocol, runtime, execution, and development patterns.

---

## Conformance

An implementation conforms to this specification if:

1. All Tagged URNs normalize identically (per §3)
2. All predicates compute identically (per §4)
3. Specificity scores match (per §5)
4. Dispatch validity matches (per §7)
5. All validation rules are enforced (per §10)

Ranking policy (§8) may vary by subsystem, but dispatch validity must not.
