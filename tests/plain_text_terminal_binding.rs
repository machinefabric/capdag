//! Tests for the `media:plain-text;textable;txt` terminal-binding contract.
//!
//! Background: the wizard's path planner finds candidate terminals by
//! locating caps whose `out` conforms to the requested target media URN,
//! and feeders by locating caps whose `out` conforms to the candidate's
//! `in`. Earlier, `cap:save-as-txt` declared `in = media:textable`,
//! making the cap a universal sink — every textable-producing cap
//! (PDF page extractor, JSON-as-text adapter, prompt loader) became a
//! recommended feeder for `.txt` persistence, polluting the planner's
//! recommended-paths surface.
//!
//! The fix introduced `media:plain-text;textable;txt` as a narrow
//! concrete terminal type: producers of user-facing prose
//! (LLM text-generation, OCR's extracted text, summarisation) opt in
//! by declaring this URN as their `out`; everything else stays on
//! `media:textable` and is therefore not a candidate feeder.
//!
//! These tests pin down the order-theoretic relations the contract
//! depends on. A regression that re-loosens `save-as-txt`'s `in`, or
//! that drops the narrow-marker discipline on producer caps, will
//! flip one of the assertions and surface immediately.
