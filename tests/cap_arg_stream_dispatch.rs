//! Tests for the cap-arg stream URN dispatch contract used by every
//! cartridge handler that reads multiple streams from a single
//! invocation.
//!
//! Background: cap TOMLs declare cap-arg URNs with rich dim profiles
//! (e.g. `media:inference;limit;max-tokens;numeric;task;user`)
//! that carry catalog-grade semantics. Cartridge handlers, however,
//! think of arguments in their bare functional shape
//! (`media:max-tokens;numeric` — "this is a numeric textable
//! tagged max-tokens"). The two URNs are semantically the same
//! parameter but they do NOT have the same tag set — `is_equivalent`
//! returns false.
//!
//! When handlers used `is_equivalent` to dispatch incoming streams to
//! parameter slots, the rich form would silently miss the parameter
//! branches and fall through to the textable catch-all (used for the
//! prompt body). Whichever conforming stream arrived last would
//! overwrite the prompt — so the model would receive `"512"` (the
//! max-tokens default), `"0.7"` (temperature), or one of the other
//! numeric defaults as its prompt and produce a continuation of that
//! fragment: math/code-style gibberish where coherent prose was
//! expected.
//!
//! The fix is to dispatch via `conforms_to(broad_pattern)`. The rich
//! cap-arg URN conforms to the bare pattern (more tags = more
//! specific); the bare textable catch-all stays last in the
//! if-chain. These tests pin the order-theoretic relations the
//! dispatch logic now depends on — a regression that flips any of
//! them re-opens the gibberish-output bug.
